Graphical sequence algorithms like an ace.

== Purpose

This is middle layer between rasterizer and high level plotting.
Rasterizer is quite simple thing. It just draws closed polygons as sequence of points.
So different complex graphical entities are build from closed polygons.
Even "lines" (actually lines with width) and text glyphs.
